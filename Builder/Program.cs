// Builder design pattern is about separating the construction process of a complex object from it's representation,
//  allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

// The builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and a step-by-step approach. The process of 
//  construction should be so generic that the same construction process can be used to create different representations 
//  of the same complex object.
