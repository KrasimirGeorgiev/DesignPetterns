// The Prototype Design Pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance
// and creates new object by copying this prototype.

// This pattern is useful when the creation of an object is time-consuming or complex in terms of resources.
// In stead of going through the costly process of creating a fresh object from scratch, an existing instance serves as a prototype,
// and new objects can be created by copying this prototype.
