// Here, instantiation is triggered by the first reference to the static member of the nested class,
// which only occurs in Instance. This means the implementation is fully lazy, but has all the performance benefits of the previous ones.
// Note that although nested classes have access to the enclosing class's private members, the reverse is not true,
// hence the need for instance to be internal here. That doesn't raise any other problems, though, as the class itself is private.
// The code is a bit more complicated in order to make the instantiation lazy, however.
