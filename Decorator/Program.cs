// Decorator design pattern allows us to dynamicaly add new functionalities to an exising object without altering
//  or modifying it's structure, and this desing pattern acts as a wrapper to the existing class. That means the 
//  decorator design pattern dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting
//  the existing functionality of the object. In short the pattern adds aditional functionalities to an object by wrapping it.
//  A decorator is an object that adds features to another object.
